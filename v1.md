Current state:
- The reference branch is forked from an [un-merged PR](https://github.com/TGSAI/mdio-python/pull/553) which slightly updates the Coordinates model.
- We have [reference implementation](https://github.com/BrianMichell/mdio-python/tree/v1_ingestion_YOLO) for:
	- [Builder pattern](https://github.com/BrianMichell/mdio-python/blob/v1_ingestion_YOLO/src/mdio/core/v1/builder.py), [Internal serialization](https://github.com/BrianMichell/mdio-python/blob/v1_ingestion_YOLO/src/mdio/core/v1/_serializer.py), [Unit test](https://github.com/BrianMichell/mdio-python/blob/v1_ingestion_YOLO/tests/unit/schema/v1/test_template_builder.py)
	- [Limited factory](https://github.com/BrianMichell/mdio-python/blob/v1_ingestion_YOLO/src/mdio/core/v1/factory.py), [Unit test](https://github.com/BrianMichell/mdio-python/blob/v1_ingestion_YOLO/tests/unit/test_template_factory.py)
	- [JSON schema](https://github.com/BrianMichell/mdio-python/tree/v1_ingestion_YOLO/src/mdio/schemas)
		- Validation is [Unit tested](https://github.com/BrianMichell/mdio-python/blob/v1_ingestion_YOLO/tests/unit/test_schema.py)
	
	- [Xarray overloads](https://github.com/BrianMichell/mdio-python/blob/v1_ingestion_YOLO/src/mdio/core/v1/_overloads.py)

	- Schematized [SEGY ingestion](https://github.com/BrianMichell/mdio-python/blob/v1_ingestion_YOLO/src/mdio/converters/segy.py#L639-L890)
		- Works for a single case, untested for more
		- No unit tests
		- Internal function calls required to be changed, several levels deep
		- Likely poor implementation
			- Questionable memory management and native threading
		
	- [SEGY export](https://github.com/BrianMichell/mdio-python/blob/v1_ingestion_YOLOsrc/mdio/converters/mdio.py#L29-L190)
		- Works for a single case, untested for more
		- No unit tests
		- Breaks v0.X compatibility (unit tests invalidated)
		- Internal function calls required to be changed, several levels deep
			- Requires MDIO file to come from ingestion (have all expected fields)
		- Only need to worry about the MDIO input, SEGY output should all be fine.


- What would be nice to have:
	- Native parallelism for MDIO I/O
		- Zarr v3 engine (added in 0.9) enables native parallelism, reducing need tomanage spawned processes.
		- I have not yet tested if this holds true for the Xarray implementation for MDIO v1.0

	- Better memory utilization
		- The reference branch borrows from an un-merged PR which seeks to reduce overall memory consumption wherever possible due to [OOM issues](https://github.com/TGSAI/mdio-python/pull/558).
