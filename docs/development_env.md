# Development Environment

To facilitate development on different systems a [dev container](https://containers.dev/) has been added. This should seamlessly enable development for users of [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) on systems with docker installed.

For contributing guidelines please look here [link](../CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Known Issues:

- `git config --global --add safe.directory $(pwd)` might be needed inside the container.
